# BlueSoundPlayer
Just a light weight browser based player for the BlueSound devices. 

A few months back I purchased a BlueSound Node2. In the process of getting to play with it, I found one short coming. A lack for some of the oddball tablets I have (old ones that still work). Wanting a light weight controller for it; I decided a webpage would be more than sufficient. This means any of my devices can consume this page. The API for it, I found in a number of places, including here. Use it, enjoy it let me know of any feature requests. I am working on a version 2, but that will take some time.
